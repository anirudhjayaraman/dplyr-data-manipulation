# INTRODUCTION TO dplyr AND tbls ----------------------------------------------------
# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Load the hflights package
library(hflights)

# Call both head() and summary() on hflights
head(hflights)
summary(hflights)


# Convert the hflights data.frame into a hflights tbl
hflights <- tbl_df(hflights)

# Display the hflights tbl
hflights

# Create the object carriers, containing only the UniqueCarrier variable of hflights
carriers <- hflights$UniqueCarrier


# Use lut to translate the UniqueCarrier column of hflights and before doing so
# glimpse hflights to see the UniqueCarrier variablle
glimpse(hflights)

lut <- c("AA" = "American", "AS" = "Alaska", "B6" = "JetBlue", "CO" = "Continental", 
         "DL" = "Delta", "OO" = "SkyWest", "UA" = "United", "US" = "US_Airways", 
         "WN" = "Southwest", "EV" = "Atlantic_Southeast", "F9" = "Frontier", 
         "FL" = "AirTran", "MQ" = "American_Eagle", "XE" = "ExpressJet", "YV" = "Mesa")
hflights$UniqueCarrier <- lut[hflights$UniqueCarrier]
# Now glimpse hflights to see the change in the UniqueCarrier variable
glimpse(hflights)

# Fill up empty entries of CancellationCode with 'E'
# To do so, first index the empty entries in CancellationCode
lut = c('A' = 'carrier', 'B' = 'weather', 'C' = 'FFA', 'D' = 'security', 
        'E' = 'not cancelled')
cancellationEmpty <- hflights$CancellationCode == ""
# Assign 'E' to the empty entries
hflights$CancellationCode[cancellationEmpty] <- 'E'

# Use the lookup table to create a vector of code labels. Assign the vector to the CancellationCode column of hflights
hflights$CancellationCode <- lut[hflights$CancellationCode]

# Inspect the resulting raw values of your variables
glimpse(hflights)

# SELECT() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

hflights[c('ActualElapsedTime','ArrDelay','DepDelay')]
# Equivalently, using dplyr:
select(hflights, ActualElapsedTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay)

# Print out a tbl with the four columns of hflights related to delay
select(hflights, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay)

# Print out hflights, nothing has changed!
hflights

# Print out the columns Origin up to Cancelled of hflights
select(hflights, Origin:Cancelled)

# Find the most concise way to select: columns Year up to and 
# including DayOfWeek, columns ArrDelay up to and including Diverted
# Answer to last question: be concise! 
# You may want to examine the order of hflight's column names before you 
# begin with names()
names(hflights)
select(hflights, -(DepTime:AirTime))

# Helper functions used with dplyr

# Print out a tbl containing just ArrDelay and DepDelay
select(hflights, ArrDelay, DepDelay)
# Use a combination of helper functions and variable names to print out 
# only the UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, Cancelled, and CancellationCode 
# columns of hflights
select(hflights, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, contains("Tail"), contains("Cancel"))

# Find the most concise way to return the following columns with select and its 
# helper functions: DepTime, ArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, 
# DepDelay. Use only helper functions
select(hflights, ends_with("Time"), ends_with("Delay"))

# Some comparisons to basic R
# both hflights and dplyr are available

ex1r <- hflights[c("TaxiIn","TaxiOut","Distance")]

# MUTATE() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Add the new variable ActualGroundTime to a copy of hflights and save the result as g1.
g1 <- mutate(hflights, ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime - AirTime)

# Add the new variable GroundTime to a g1. Save the result as g2.
g2 <- mutate(g1, GroundTime = TaxiIn + TaxiOut)

# Add the new variable AverageSpeed to g2. Save the result as g3.
g3 <- mutate(g2, AverageSpeed = Distance / AirTime * 60)

# Print out g3

# Add a second variable loss_percent to the dataset: m1
m1 <- mutate(hflights, loss = ArrDelay - DepDelay, 
             loss_percent = ((ArrDelay - DepDelay)/DepDelay)*100)

# mutate() allows you to use a new variable while creating a next variable 
# in the same call
# Copy and adapt the previous command to reduce redendancy: m2
m2 <- mutate(hflights, loss = ArrDelay - DepDelay, 
             loss_percent = (loss/DepDelay) * 100 )

# Add the three variables as described in the third instruction: m3
m3 <- mutate(hflights, TotalTaxi = TaxiIn + TaxiOut, 
             ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime - AirTime, 
             Diff = TotalTaxi - ActualGroundTime)

# FILTER() --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Print out all flights in hflights that traveled 3000 or more miles
filter(hflights, Distance > 3000)

# All flights flown by one of JetBlue, Southwest, or Delta
filter(hflights, UniqueCarrier %in% c('JetBlue', 'Southwest', 'Delta'))

# All flights where taxiing took longer than flying
filter(hflights, TaxiIn + TaxiOut > AirTime)

# Combining tests using boolean operators

# All flights that departed before 5am or arrived after 10pm
filter(hflights, DepTime < 500 | ArrTime > 2200 )

# All flights that departed late but arrived ahead of schedule
filter(hflights, DepDelay > 0 & ArrDelay < 0)

# All cancelled weekend flights
filter(hflights, DayOfWeek %in% c(6,7) & Cancelled == 1)

# All flights that were cancelled after being delayed
filter(hflights, Cancelled == 1, DepDelay > 0)

# Summarizing Exercise
# Select the flights that had JFK as their destination: c1
c1 <- filter(hflights, Dest == 'JFK')

# Combine the Year, Month and DayofMonth variables to create a Date column: c2
c2 <- mutate(c1, Date = paste(Year, Month, DayofMonth, sep = "-"))

# Print out a selection of columns of c2
select(c2, Date, DepTime, ArrTime, TailNum)

# How many weekend flights flew a distance of more than 1000 miles 
# but had a total taxiing time below 15 minutes?

# ARRANGE() --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Keep flights leaving to DFW before 8am and arrange according to decreasing AirTime 
arrange(filter(hflights, Dest == 'DFW', DepTime < 800), desc(AirTime))

# list containing only TailNum of flights that departed too late, sorted by 
# total taxiing time
# First select a threshold for departure delay by finding max DepDelay
max(filter(select(hflights, DepDelay), !is.na(DepDelay)))
select(arrange(filter(hflights, DepDelay > 360), TaxiIn + TaxiOut), TailNum)

# SUMMARISE() -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Print out a summary with variables min_dist and max_dist
summarize(hflights, min_dist = min(Distance), max_dist = max(Distance))

# Print out a summary with variable max_div
summarize(filter(hflights, Diverted == 1), max_div = max(Distance))

# Remove rows that have NA ArrDelay: temp1

summarise(hflights, n_obs = n(), n_carrier = n_distinct(UniqueCarrier), 
          n_dest = n_distinct(Dest), dest100 = nth(Dest, 100))

# %>% OPERATOR ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ADVANCED PIPING EXERCISES
# Use one single piped call to print a summary with the following variables:
  
# n_non - the number of non-preferable flights in hflights,
# p_non - the percentage of non-preferable flights in hflights,
# n_dest - the number of destinations that non-preferable flights traveled to,
# min_dist - the minimum distance that non-preferable flights traveled,

# p_canc, the percentage of cancelled flights; avg_delay, the average arrival delay of 
# flights whose delay does not equal NA. Next, order the carriers in the summary from
